## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: 
  - Local component state
  - React Context for global state
  - React Query for server state
- **Styling**: 
  - CSS Modules or Styled Components
  - Design system implementation
- **Routing**: React Router v6+
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### Backend Integration

- RESTful API consumption
- GraphQL integration (optional)
- WebSockets for real-time features

- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for user flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Automated deployments from development branch
- Feature branches for new functionality
- Pull request previews

### Staging Environment
- Deployed from staging branch
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

### Production Environment
- Deployed from main branch
- Blue/green deployment
- Automated rollback capability
- Continuous monitoring

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance issues with feed | High | Medium | Implement virtualization and pagination early |
| Real-time messaging complexity | Medium | High | Start with simpler implementation, then enhance |
| Data modeling challenges | Medium | Medium | Spend adequate time on data architecture planning |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Use modern tooling and cross-browser testing |

### Project Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Clear PRD, strict change management process |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Build in buffer time, prioritize features |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Identify core team needs early, have backup plans |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Create detailed API specifications early |

## Success Criteria

- All core features implemented according to PRD
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance achieved
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Successful user testing feedback
- No critical or high-severity bugs at launch
