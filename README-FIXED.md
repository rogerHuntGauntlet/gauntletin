# GauntletIn Fixes

## Firebase Integration Issues Fixed

The application wasn't saving data to Firebase because:

1. There was no proper data persistence layer connecting UI actions to Firestore
2. Firebase was only set up for authentication but not for data storage

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Created Firestore Service Layer**: 
   - Added `src/lib/firestore.ts` with comprehensive services for:
     - Posts (create, like, fetch)
     - Messages (send, fetch, mark as read)
     - Jobs (apply, save, fetch)

2. **Connected UI to Firestore**:
   - Updated Dashboard page to save/retrieve posts from Firestore
   - Updated Messaging page to save/retrieve messages from Firestore
   - Updated Jobs page to save/retrieve job data from Firestore

3. **Fixed Common Issues**:
   - Added proper type definitions for Firestore data
   - Fixed batch update syntax for marking messages as read
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Ensured data persistence across page refreshes

## Pages Updated

1. **Dashboard**:
   - Posts are now saved to Firestore
   - Like interactions persist in database
   - Posts are loaded from database on refresh

2. **Messaging**:
   - Messages are saved to conversations in Firestore
   - Unread counts are tracked and updated
   - Conversation history persists across sessions

3. **Jobs**:
   - Saved jobs state is persisted in Firestore
   - Job applications are tracked in database
   - Filter state works with real data

## How to Test

1. **Create a Post**:
   - Go to Dashboard page
   - Create a post with the "Start a post" button
   - Verify it appears in the feed
   - Refresh the page and confirm it's still there

2. **Send Messages**:
   - Go to Messaging page
   - Select a conversation
   - Send a message
   - Verify it's saved and visible after refresh

3. **Save/Apply for Jobs**:
   - Go to Jobs page
   - Use the "Save" or "Apply" buttons
   - Check that the state persists after refresh
   - Look at "Saved Jobs" tab to confirm

## Additional Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Added elegant error messages across the application
   - Implemented retry functionality for failed operations

2. **Loading States**:
   - Added loading indicators for data-fetching operations

3. **Empty States**:
   - Added user-friendly UI when no data is available

## Next Steps

1. Implement user management features
2. Add image upload for posts and messages
3. Create real-time updates using Firestore listeners
4. Add comment functionality on posts
